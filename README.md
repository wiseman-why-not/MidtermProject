## Overview
* [Overview of Midterm Project](https://github.com/SkillDistillery/SD24/blob/master/midtermGroupProject/README.md)

## Feature Sets

* A fully developed database schema. The database must be connected to your Java code using JPA.

* Our friend C.R.U.D, this time manipulating objects and saving them in an appropriate database table.

* A user log in, which is authenticated by a mySQL table. There should be different permission levels for the users, one admin that can add/update/delete content present on the site.

* A correct implementation of a session object, this can be used to track a logged in user and any changes they make (for example, a shopping cart or favorites list).

* A way to track an individual user's previous experiences on the site. For example if it is a food ordering system, a list of previous orders.

## Challenges
* We learned the challenges of using Github in a group of this size. We started out this project struggling to make sure we were all pushing and pulling at exactly the right times. We also realized how necessary relatively constant contact was during this process.

* One team member had a previously planned visit from a good friend, which limited their time and contributions early in the project. This was resolved by the following Monday, but it contributed to the difficulty in the delegation of work amongst the group.

* It was not a huge challenge, but we realized that we did not initially each have the same vision of direction for our application. We had the same over-arching idea for the project, but the finer details were blurred amongst us. We eventually were able to come to a consensus, but that path was not necessarily the easiest to navigate at first.
